# GE2-Space-Assignment
This is the repository for my Game Engines 2 Assignment.

Class Group: DT228/4

For this Assignment I recreated the intro to Star Wars A new Hope

Two Spaceships come flying in off screen. The smaller ship is fleeing from the larger Imperial Destroyer Ship. The camera remains fixed as the two space crafts enter into view
and watches them pass by.
